## 🔧 Customization Ideas

**Easy Wins:**
1. Change colors in `tailwind.config.js`
2. Add company logo to login page
3. Customize invoice PDF layout
4. Add more product fields (SKU, category)
5. Add email notifications (Flask-Mail)

**Advanced:**
1. Multi-currency support
2. Inventory tracking
3. Payment integration (Stripe)
4. Email invoices to customers
5. Recurring invoices

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Single User Focus**: Designed for 1-5 users per instance
2. **SQLite Concurrency**: Max 10-20 concurrent users
3. **No Email**: PDF download only (no email sending)
4. **No Payments**: Invoice tracking only (no payment processing)
5. **Basic Reports**: Dashboard only (no custom reports)

**When to Upgrade:**
- More than 20 concurrent users → Migrate to PostgreSQL
- Need payments → Integrate Stripe/PayPal
- Need emails → Add Flask-Mail
- Need advanced reports → Add custom query builder

---

## 📈 Scalability Path

**Current Capacity:**
- Users: 1-20 concurrent
- Invoices: 100,000+
- Database: Up to 10GB (practical limit)

**Upgrade Path:**
1. **Phase 1** (0-1000 invoices): Current setup ✅
2. **Phase 2** (1000-10k invoices): Add Redis caching
3. **Phase 3** (10k+ invoices): Migrate to PostgreSQL
4. **Phase 4** (Multi-tenant): Add user organizations
